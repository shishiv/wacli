# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added

- Groups: add a read-only `groups participants list` command for local roster snapshots and refresh those snapshots with `sync --refresh-groups`.
- Verification: add a reusable live text → interactive selection → reply driver with latency evidence.

### Fixed

- Messages: extract comment bodies and album summaries in live/history sync, preserving comment reply targets and matching quote metadata. (#383 - thanks @shishiv and @Entretoize)
- Sync: keep `--follow --json` stdout valid NDJSON by routing libsignal errors to stderr.
- Send: reuse cached PN-to-LID mappings before live registration lookup to avoid repeated warmup delays for known recipients.
- CLI: keep successful JSON commands successful when a pipe reader closes early, including Unix stdout SIGPIPE and Windows closed-pipe errors. (#366 - thanks @SebTardif)
- Groups: warn on stderr when `groups list` truncates matching results, including JSON output, and keep `--events` warnings machine-readable. (#360 - thanks @hchittanuru3)
- Sync: update whatsmeow so incoming socket frames use the active connection context.
- History: retry an unanswered backfill anchor once with the next local message, report both anchors, and keep retries bounded without deleting history or filtering message IDs. (#371 - thanks @Entretoize)
- Messages: omit synthetic audio captions while preserving supplied text and the `[Audio]` display fallback; ordinary re-ingestion can correct legacy captions without migrating untouched rows. (#378 - thanks @hchittanuru3)

### Chore

- Builds: use Go 1.27.1 for development, CI, release verification, and Docker while retaining the Go 1.27.0 source minimum.

- Dependencies: update whatsmeow, x/crypto, gqlparser, pnpm 11, and the Pages deployment action; keep Corepack bootstrap compatible with a verified integrity pin. (#384 - thanks @thedavidweng)
- Dependencies: update Go modules, pnpm, CI actions, GoReleaser, and Docker images; require Go 1.27.0 and align local, CI, and release toolchain checks.

## v0.17.1 - 2026-08-14

### Fixed

- Auth: stop with an actionable error when WhatsApp requires unsupported passkey pairing instead of silently rotating unusable QR codes. (#355 - thanks @Avg8888)
- Sync: normalize resolvable LIDs in message, receipt, and chat-presence webhook payloads to match stored identities. (#352 - thanks @hchittanuru3)
## v0.17.0 - 2026-08-13

**Highlight:** group identities are finally stable — resolvable LIDs are
normalized everywhere they appear, and existing stores are repaired on upgrade.

### Fixed

- Sync: normalize resolvable LIDs in group owners, participants, and quoted senders, including historical store repair. (#348 - thanks @hchittanuru3)

### Added

- Messages: expose persisted edited state consistently in list, search, show, and context JSON output. (#347 - thanks @dvainrub)
- Sync: identify unhandled payload types when content extraction produces a placeholder, with bounded diagnostics during history replay. (#344 - thanks @dvainrub)

### Chore

- Dependencies: update `whatsmeow` for current socket headers, LID history tokens, status queries, and group creation behavior.

## 0.16.0 - 2026-08-02

### Added

- Locations: send native WhatsApp location pins and retain incoming static or live coordinates in local history with full purge, cleanup, and identity-migration lifecycle support. (#338 - thanks @0xlucuma)

### Fixed

- Groups: preserve message-derived chat activity when refreshing group metadata so `chats list` ordering is not replaced by refresh time. (#340 - thanks @goutamadwant)

### Chore

- Dependencies: update `go-sqlite3`, `whatsmeow`, database tooling, gRPC, WebAssembly, telemetry, and supporting Go modules.

## 0.15.2 - 2026-08-02

### Added

- Contacts: add `contacts check <phone> [phone...]` to query live whether numbers are registered on WhatsApp, with JSON output for scripting; per-number `responded` distinguishes a server non-answer from a confirmed "not registered". (#331)

### Fixed

- Send: surface local history failures after a delivered file, voice, or status send as a `store_warning` (stderr warning plus JSON field) instead of silently diverging local history, while keeping the delivered message id so scripts do not retry an already-sent message. (#328 - thanks @SebTardif)
- Send: extend the `store_warning` partial-success contract to every remaining send surface — text, sticker, reactions, polls, poll votes, button/list selections, and message forwarding — including sends delegated to a running `sync --follow` process.

### Docs

- README: align the project overview, install paths, quickstart, and command map with the shared documentation standard.

## 0.15.1 - 2026-08-01

### Added

- Sync: add opt-in `--send-spacing` fixed or randomized pacing for sends delegated to a running follow process. (#318 - thanks @cohnen)
- Sync: add opt-in receipt and chat-presence webhook events while keeping legacy message payloads unchanged. (#315 - thanks @Jaime-data)

### Fixed

- Sync: stop promptly when WhatsApp revokes the linked session, including while a reconnect is already in progress, and print the re-authentication steps. (#325 - thanks @cohnen)
- Send: keep self-chat storage under the canonical phone-number chat and reject text sends to the linked account itself instead of reporting an acknowledgement that may never reach Message Yourself. (#319 - thanks @Lucas-Kim-J)
- Send: resolve quoted direct messages across phone-number and LID chat aliases so replies can find migrated history. (#326 - thanks @0xlucuma)

### Chore

- Dependencies: update `whatsmeow`, terminal support, GraphQL parsing, and supporting Go modules.
- Tooling: update the pinned pnpm version from 10.34.4 to 11.18.0.
- Build: migrate `sqlc` code generator to Go 1.24+ `go tool` directive and bump project toolchain requirement to Go 1.26.5. (#313 - thanks @thedavidweng)
- Build: standardize the Makefile's build, check, snapshot, and verified local-release targets across the crawler repositories.
- Release: publish v0.15.0 under a one-time clean-VM Gatekeeper waiver, with retroactive VM proof still required when hardware returns, and verify preserved drafts against their release commit's Go toolchain.

## 0.15.0 - 2026-07-23

### Highlights

- Send files with an explicit WhatsApp media type, so an MP3 can be delivered as a downloadable document while retaining its audio MIME type. (thanks @DiegoDAF)
- Webhooks now include the locally resolved chat name when it is available. (#312 - thanks @g1e2x87)

### Added

- Send: add `send file --as auto|document|audio|image|video` to choose the WhatsApp media type independently of MIME, including downloadable MP3 documents. (thanks @DiegoDAF)

### Fixed

- Sync: include locally resolved chat names in webhook payloads when available. (#312 - thanks @g1e2x87)

## 0.14.0 - 2026-07-19

### Highlights

- Deleted messages now keep their original payload behind timestamped tombstones, with an explicit confirmation-gated purge command for irreversible erasure.
- Message edits now delegate through a running `sync --follow` process instead of failing while the sync process owns the store lock. (#310 - thanks @Umair444)
- Text replies can again quote stored documents and other supported media. (#307 - thanks @suifatt7799-oss)

### Added

- Messages: add an explicit, confirmation-gated `messages purge` command that irreversibly erases one retained payload while keeping a durable suppression tombstone.

### Changed

- Messages: retain original text, interactive, reply, and media metadata behind timestamped deletion tombstones; keep sync/history imports merge-only so missing rows never imply deletion.
- WhatsApp compatibility: update `whatsmeow` for the latest protocol definitions and its required utility module.

### Fixed

- Store: preserve duplicate local media paths across LID-to-phone-number migration so a later payload purge erases every retained copy.
- Send: delegate `messages edit` through a running `sync --follow` process like other send commands, so edits no longer always fail with `store is locked` while continuous sync owns the store. (#310 - thanks @Umair444)
- Send: allow text replies to quote stored documents and other supported media by rebuilding their saved message content. (#307 - thanks @suifatt7799-oss)

## 0.13.0 - 2026-07-17

### Highlights

- Sync can now stay quiet during long-running mirror sessions so the primary phone keeps normal notification behavior. (#298 - thanks @GodsBoy)
- Text replies now carry complete quoted-message context through direct and delegated sends. (#302 - thanks @odilorg)
- Windows auth and store access now handle drive-letter and UNC paths without invalid SQLite URI errors. (#304 - thanks @goutamadwant)
- Official release artifacts now use a signed, notarized, provenance-bound draft-first pipeline with protected verification and Homebrew handoff.

### Added

- Sync: add opt-in `--presence-mode quiet` to suppress available-presence updates during long-running sync sessions while retaining safe unavailable cleanup. (#298 - thanks @GodsBoy)

### Fixed

- Messages: preserve quoted content, stanza IDs, and participants when replying to stored incoming or outgoing text messages, including through sync IPC delegation. (#302 - thanks @odilorg)
- Windows: normalize drive-letter and UNC paths before constructing SQLite file URIs so auth and read-only store opens no longer fail with invalid URI authority. (#304 - thanks @goutamadwant)
- WhatsApp compatibility: update `whatsmeow` for current protobufs, LID direct-message sends, pairing, and user lookup behavior. (#306)

### Security

- Build: require Go 1.25.12 and gate source plus release binaries with `govulncheck` so reachable GO-2026-5856 standard-library paths are excluded.
- Release: sign all official macOS thin and universal binaries with the exact OpenClaw Foundation Developer ID metadata and designated requirement, hardened runtime, timestamp, and Apple notarization before draft upload; require naturally quarantined clean-VM execution as the standalone CLI Gatekeeper proof.
- Release: bind cross-build provenance and publication freshness to the current protected head, reject wrong linker/runtime versions and lookalike signing authorities, revalidate the exact draft and fresh published release by ID, and verify protected Homebrew handoff, formula stanzas, plus the installed binary's hash, architecture, signing identity, runtime, and notarization constraint.
- Release: move official publication to a local draft-first flow with authenticated cross-build provenance, separate protected-main native verification, a signed annotated exact tag, verified public-release and Homebrew manifests, and credential-free CI builds.

### Changed

- Dependencies: update `go-sqlite3`, the Go networking stack, and `whatsmeow` with its required transitive modules. (#305, #306)
- Tooling: require Node.js 24 or newer and enforce a 48-hour minimum release age for pnpm packages. (thanks @vincentkoc)

## 0.12.0 - 2026-07-06

### Added

- Media: add `media backfill` to download media for already-synced messages that have metadata but no local copy. (thanks @njt)
- Media: add `media retry` to recover CDN-expired media from the primary device. (thanks @njt)

### Security

- Store: replace dynamic schema-inspection SQL with fixed allowlisted queries. (thanks @dovocoder)

### Fixed

- Sync: finish queued media downloads before clean one-shot and bootstrap exits instead of canceling them at idle. (thanks @njt)

## 0.11.2 - 2026-07-02

### Added

### Security

- Store: escape SQLite file URI path delimiters so store names cannot alter connection parameters. (thanks @vincentkoc)
- Docs: escape raw HTML in generated-site link labels and give duplicate headings stable unique IDs. (thanks @vincentkoc)

### Fixed

- WhatsApp compatibility: update `whatsmeow` for current protocol metadata, privacy tokens on more request types, and pairing/connect handling.
- Sync: keep linked-device presence accurate while sync is running and send unavailable presence on shutdown so phones resume push notifications. (#283)
- WhatsApp connectivity: update `whatsmeow` for the current WhatsApp protocol and fix `405 (Client Outdated)` failures. (#280)
- Channels: report local cache persistence failures instead of silently returning incomplete success. (thanks @vincentkoc)
- Cleanup: reject non-positive `chats cleanup --days` values before opening the store. (thanks @vincentkoc)

## 0.11.1 - 2026-06-11

### Added

- Groups: add live admin commands for creating groups, setting descriptions, toggling announce-only and admin-only edits, and approving or rejecting join requests. (#265 - thanks @dovocoder)
- Groups: include resolved phone numbers in pending join request output when LID mappings are available. (#273 - thanks @cielecki)
- Presence: delegate typing and paused indicators through the sync daemon send socket when the store lock is held. (#272 - thanks @kidshaker)
- Profile: add commands to remove the profile picture, set About text, set the profile display name, fetch profile picture metadata, fetch a user's About text, and fetch WhatsApp Business profile details. (#267 - thanks @dovocoder)
- Sync: add opt-in keepalive-failure stale detection for `sync --follow` (`1s` to `<2m20s`), including forced reconnect, a `stale` NDJSON event, a private store `HEARTBEAT`, and `doctor --json` `last_activity_at`. (#278 - thanks @thedavidweng)

### Security

- Media: bound direct WhatsApp media downloads with a response-header timeout while preserving the caller's body download budget. (#271 - thanks @jason-allen-oneal)

### Fixed

- Media: download synced WhatsApp GIF playback videos by treating their stored `gif` label as video-encrypted media. (#274 - thanks @larskluge)
- Sync: reconnect after WhatsApp replaces the linked-device stream instead of leaving `sync --follow` offline. (#266 - thanks @ngutman)
- Sync: clear chat unread state from `ReceiptTypeReadSelf` receipts so linked-device reads still update when `regular_high` app-state sync is unhealthy. (#269 - thanks @p-jackson1)

## 0.11.0 - 2026-05-22

### Added

- Chats: store unread marker state and numeric `unread_count` separately; migrate existing stores away from sentinel unread values while preserving public chat JSON fields. (#255 - thanks @drelum and @dovocoder)
- Messages: add explicit `messages revoke` and `messages forward` commands for stored text and media/document messages. (#259 - thanks @dovocoder)
- Messages: persist quoted message ID and quoted sender JID metadata from WhatsApp reply context. (#260)
- Send: add `send select` to choose stored inbound WhatsApp quick-reply buttons and list rows from scripts. (#258 - thanks @morgs)

### Security

### Fixed

- Sync: store messages sent from other linked devices in the destination chat as outgoing messages.
- Calls: import call-log records from full history syncs and the `regular` app-state collection so old call events can be stored even when the live call signaling was missed. (#256)

### Docs

- Docs: update Homebrew install and release-token references to the OpenClaw Homebrew tap. (#254 - thanks @dovocoder)

## 0.10.0 - 2026-05-20

### Added

- Media: allow `media download --read-only` when `--output` is explicit, so synced media can be fetched without opening the WhatsApp session store or recording download state. (#250 - thanks @mbelinky)

### Security

### Fixed

- Release: publish target-specific macOS/Linux/Windows archives with one combined checksum file and update the OpenClaw Homebrew tap.
- Connect: send an `available` presence after authenticated connect so the server records the linked-device pushname; without it, downstream recipients receive `notify=""` and Cloud API verified-business webhooks silently drop the message at the gateway. (#252 - thanks @ceifa)

## 0.9.2 - 2026-05-17

### Added

- Send: add `wacli send status` for WhatsApp status broadcasts, including text statuses with optional background/font and media statuses with captions. (#247 - thanks @dovocoder)
- Store: persist synced and locally sent status broadcasts separately in `status_messages` instead of mixing them into normal chat messages.

### Security

- CI: pin GitHub Actions and Docker base images to immutable refs and pin GoReleaser to an exact version.
- Send: block automatic link previews from fetching localhost, private, link-local, multicast, and other non-public addresses.
- Sync: validate webhook URLs, redact webhook errors, disable private-network webhook targets by default, and add `--webhook-allow-private` for trusted local endpoints.

### Fixed

- Accounts: serialize account config mutations with a config lock and save through unique temporary files.
- CLI: strip terminal control characters from human/table/error output.
- CLI: open the local store through SQLite read-only mode for `--read-only` commands instead of initializing writer state.
- Media: enforce regular-file and size limits for sends, stickers, voice notes, profile pictures, contacts imports, thumbnails, and unknown-length downloads.
- Messages: make `--delete-media --for-me` remove the stored local media file when present.
- Store: count all chats and groups in `store stats` instead of the first 50 entries.
- Sync: warn when bootstrap contact/group/channel refresh fails instead of silently ignoring it.
- Sync: bound each webhook delivery request so shutdown is not stuck behind a slow endpoint.
- History: unwrap edited WhatsApp messages during history sync and backfill so stored/searchable text shows the edited body instead of `(message)`. (#246 - thanks @hiasinho)
- Polls: use WhatsApp's single-select poll creation field for outbound single-select polls and preserve unmatched poll vote hashes in `poll show --json`. (#248 - thanks @dovocoder)
- Sync: canonicalize `@lid` chat JIDs before enqueuing media downloads so `sync --follow --download-media` finds the correct DB row for live one-to-one messages. (#244 - thanks @Daniel1of1)

## 0.9.1 - 2026-05-15

### Added

- Calls: persist WhatsApp call signaling and call-log metadata, and add `wacli calls list`.

### Fixed

- Accounts: reject invalid account configs before saving and ignore relative `XDG_STATE_HOME` for default state paths.
- CLI: honor canceled store-lock waits before acquiring locks and stop reporting non-contention lock failures as ordinary contention.
- Media: fail before downloading when the output directory exists but is not writable.
- Media: sanitize `#`, control-wrapped blanks, and single-dot path components in generated media paths.
- Store: remove starred-message metadata when deleting chat-local data so cleanup cannot leave stale starred state behind.

## 0.9.0 - 2026-05-15

### Added

- Docker: add a local image with `/data` persistence, bundled `ffmpeg`, and Docker CI smoke coverage.
- Polls: add sending, voting, local result inspection, and sync persistence for WhatsApp polls. (#230 - thanks @Ortes)
- Send: add opt-in `send text --ephemeral` wrapping for disappearing-message chats. (#227 - thanks @AndroidPoet)

### Security

- Store: harden private-file writes and use static SQL for message reaction migrations. (#241 - thanks @cy701)

### Fixed

- Messages: preserve WhatsApp Business buttons and list options in JSON output. (#226 - thanks @ignaciovarela)
- Messages: extract WhatsApp NativeFlow interactive buttons from business messages. (#233 - thanks @ignaciovarela and @mturac)
- Send: canonicalize direct phone-number recipients before sending so WhatsApp accepts regional number rewrites. (#212, #240 - thanks @ceifa)
- Send: warm up recipients before send to reduce privacy-token failures. (#234 - thanks @AndroidPoet)

### Docs

- Docs: document named accounts in the quickstart and surface accounts, channels, store, and integrations pages in the docs navigation. (#235 - thanks @mamarchk)

### Chore

- Store: generate typed SQLite query wrappers with sqlc for stable store reads and writes.

- Maintainers: remove the stale personal CODEOWNERS rule after the OpenClaw move. (#218 - thanks @dinakars777)
- Release: update GoReleaser archive config to the current v2 schema so release-config checks stay green.

### Fixed

- CLI: truncate table output by rune so emoji and other non-ASCII text stay valid UTF-8. (#222 - thanks @dinakars777)
- History: apply coverage/actionable filters before `LIMIT` so newer blocked chats do not hide ready chats. (#219 - thanks @dinakars777)
- Messages: extract display/search text from shared WhatsApp contact cards, including vCard phone numbers. (#214)
- Send: route whatsmeow diagnostics to stderr and clarify that `sent: true` means WhatsApp accepted the send request. (#215 - thanks @dinakars777)
- Sync: let explicit `--max-messages=0` override `WACLI_SYNC_MAX_MESSAGES`. (#220 - thanks @dinakars777)

## 0.8.0 - 2026-05-07

### Added

- Accounts: add first-class named WhatsApp accounts with isolated stores, `--account NAME`, and `wacli accounts list/add/use/show/remove`.

### Fixed

- Sync: decrypt encrypted reactions delivered through history sync before storing them. (#192 — thanks @matrixise)
- Sync: resolve live `@lid` chat and sender JIDs to phone-number JIDs before storing messages. (#196 — thanks @mahidconseil)
- Sync: warn when encrypted reaction messages cannot be decrypted instead of dropping the failure silently. (#192 — thanks @matrixise and @dinakars777)
- CLI: emit command errors as NDJSON `error` events when `--events` is enabled.
- Sync: keep `sync --once` idle timing focused on message/history events so connection chatter cannot hang exit. (#119 — thanks @jyothepro)
- Sync: start `sync --once` idle timing after the `Connected` event. (#171 — thanks @fuleinist)
- Sync: include event type, stack trace, and recovery count when logging recovered event-handler panics. (#181 — thanks @shaun0927)
- Sync: apply bounded backpressure to media download enqueueing instead of spawning unbounded overflow goroutines. (#121 — thanks @jyothepro)

- Docs: add companion integration guidance for safe read-only SQLite, JSON, events, and webhook usage. (#71 — thanks @jaredtribe)
- Maintainers: add CODEOWNERS and maintainer contact info.
- Agents: add AGENTS.md for AI agent guidance. (#190 — thanks @adhitShet)

### Chore

- CI: compile-test the Windows lock package to catch platform regressions. (#188 — thanks @dinakars777)
- CLI: route `version` output through Cobra's configured output stream for easier command tests. (#78 — thanks @nikolasdehor)
- Dependencies: update Go modules including `whatsmeow`, `go-sqlite3`, `x/*`, and related runtime libs; refresh the pinned pnpm toolchain.
- Refactor: split WhatsApp message parsing into focused text, media, business, and context helpers.
- Refactor: inject clocks in app/store paths for deterministic tests.
- Version: bump CLI version string to `0.7.0`.

## 0.6.0 - 2026-04-14

### Security

- Search: sanitize FTS5 user queries and escape LIKE wildcards to avoid query-syntax injection.
- Store: reject SQLite URI path injection via `?` and `#`, guard empty table names, and strip null/control chars from sanitized paths.
- Sync: recover panics in event handlers and media workers instead of crashing the process.

### Fixed

- Sync: bound reconnect duration so long-running commands do not hold the store lock forever.
- CLI: force exit on a second SIGINT during long-running commands.

### Added

- Store: add `WACLI_STORE_DIR` to configure the default store directory.

### Chore

- Dependencies: bump `filippo.io/edwards25519`.

## 0.5.0 - 2026-04-12

### Fixed

- WhatsApp connectivity: update `whatsmeow` for the current WhatsApp protocol and fix `405 (Client Outdated)` failures.

### Changed

- Internal architecture: split store and groups command logic into focused modules for cleaner maintenance and safer follow-up changes.
- Dependencies: bump core Go modules including `whatsmeow`, `go-sqlite3`, and `x/*` runtime libs.

### Build

- CI: extract a shared setup action and reuse it across CI and release workflows.
- Release: install arm64 libc headers in release workflow to improve ARM build reliability.

### Docs

- README: update usage/docs for the 0.2.0 release baseline.
